<p><em>Kannur Lokesh Rahul (/kənuːr loʊkeɪʃ ˌrɑːhʊl/; born 18 April 1992) is an Indian international cricketer. A right-handed wicket-keeping batsman, Rahul captains the Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League. He is an occasional captain of India national cricket team.

He made his international debut in 2014 against Australia in the Boxing Day Test-match in Melbourne. Two years after his Test debut, Rahul made his One-Day International Debut in 2016 against Zimbabwe, where he scored his first century by hitting a six on the last ball to reach 100*(115) from 94(114), which was also the only six of the entire match. On the same tour, he made his T20I debut.[1]

Rahul is the first and only Indian cricketer to score an ODI century on his debut. He is the fastest batsman in the world to score an International century across all three formats, taking only 20 innings to achieve this feat.[2]</em></p>
